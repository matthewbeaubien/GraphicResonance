		<h3>[elementary effect]	</h3>
		
		<p>	Filtration refers to the manipulation of sounds by their mode of propagation, environment, or method of reproduction. This effect becomes apparent when one perceives a sound to change. When moving from one room to another, we hear a sound become muffled through the walls (dullness). A sound can also filtered electro-acoustically through the recording of a sound through a mic before being played through a speaker. Propagation of sound can be filtered through the substrate of propagation, (such as air, water, etc.). It can also be filtered and changed by the interference of other sounds, like a church bell being filtered through the urban drone. Sound is, most of all, filtered through the ear drums that resonate and the brains which perceive that resonance as sound. Each person filters sound differently. 
		<br>All of the sounds that effect the compositions in this project are filtered through the qualities of the microphone used to capture the sound as well as my configuration of the effect that they make. The sound is filtered and represented differently in each composition in order to exhibit different qualities and effects of sound.
