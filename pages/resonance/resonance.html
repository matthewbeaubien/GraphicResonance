		<h3>[elementary effect]	</h3>
		
		<p>	Resonance is a physical phenomenon that is observable in systems that employ sinusoidal movement, namely mechanics, acoustics, optics and electronics. In the field of acoustics,  resonance refers to the vibration of an object by a sound produced by another object. Resonance includes any sonic occurrence and is most often observed as reverberation. For an object to resonate with a sound, Augoyard and Torgue define four categories that need to be fulfilled:
		<br>
			“ 1. The system must have a characteristic frequency.
			2. It must be maintained with a constant energy input.
			3. the loss of exterior energy must be low enough that the transmitted energy remains superior or equal the the internal loss of the system
			4. the exciting frequency must be equal or almost equal to the characteristic frequency of the system.”
		<br>
		Musical instruments are built upon the the principle of resonance. The body of a guitar or violin acts as an amplifier for the vibrations produced by the strings. Resonance is also important for the construction of a concert hall for the sound to be carried and sustained to every part of the room.
		<br>
		The title of this project is Graphic Resonance. This refers to the effort to create a graphic analogue to the sonic domain. The compositions resonate with the sounds produced in an ambiance and can then be captured as “resonant graphics”. These resonant graphics are artifacts constructed by a concordance between the creator of the system, the environment, and the observer.
